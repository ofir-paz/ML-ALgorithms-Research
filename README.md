## PLA
The Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) is a binary classification algorithm. It aims to find a hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared errors.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome. It uses a logistic function to map the input variables to the output probabilities.

## MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits. It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

## Conclusion
In this research, we explored the performance of the PLA, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression algorithms on the MNIST dataset. The full discussion including the results can be founnd in the [notebook](research.ipynb).
